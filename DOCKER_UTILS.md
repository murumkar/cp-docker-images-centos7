# docker-utils

##Overview

This is set of utilites which are used by the Confluent Docker images. It has two command line utilities which are used for testing if a Zookeeper or Kafka cluster is healthy and ready to accept client requests.


##How does it work ?

**zk-ready**

This command tries to connect to the cluster and waits for events which signify if the Zookeeper ensemble is ready.

| SASL Enabled ?   | Zookeeper Events   |
|---|---|
| No  | SyncConnected  |
| Yes  |SyncConnected, SaslAuthenticated  |

**kafka-ready**
This command sends a metadata query to the broker and verifies that expected number of brokers are present.


##How to package / run ?

1. Create a jar with dependencies

		 mvn clean compile assembly:single

## How to test ?

1. JUnit tests: mvn test

``bootstrap.servers``
  A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping&mdash;this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form <code>host1:port1,host2:port2,...</code>. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).

``ssl.key.password``
  The password of the private key in the key store file. This is optional for client.

  * Type: password

``ssl.keystore.location``
  The location of the key store file. This is optional for client and can be used for two-way authentication for client.

  * Type: string

``ssl.keystore.password``
  The store password for the key store file.This is optional for client and only needed if ssl.keystore.location is configured.

  SASL mechanism used for client connections. This may be any mechanism for which a security provider is available. GSSAPI is the default mechanism.

  * Type: string

``ssl.protocol``
  The SSL protocol used to generate the SSLContext. Default setting is TLS, which is fine for most cases. Allowed values in recent JVMs are TLS, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2. SSL, SSLv2 and SSLv3 may be supported in older JVMs, but their usage is discouraged due to known security vulnerabilities.

  * Type: string
